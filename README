Sinatra CRUD without the "update"

The inspiration for this project:

1) i needed it
2) it serves as a great excersise to illustrate the motivation for using Rails
3) if all you need is to push a static/key-value micro-site you're good to go.

Test:
$> bundle install
$> rackup

go to http://localhost:9292/

you should see "nachos"
coolbeans, redis/sinatra are working

* optional (but i do it everytime)

Heroku:
$> heroku create
$> heroku addons:add redistogo
*$> heroku apps:rename enter_new_name
$> git push heroku master
$> heroku open

you should see "nachos"
dope nachos, heroku/redis/sinatra are working

Is this all wrong?
